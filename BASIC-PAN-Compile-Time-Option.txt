-DBFS
Force verifier to use breadth-first search algorithm instead of the standard depth-first search.
This use more memory and restricts the type of properties that can be verified to safety properties only.
(can be combined with other options to reduce memory use such as h
 ash-compact, bitstate-hashing, collapse-compression and minimized automaton -compression)

-DMEMCNT=N
Sets an upper bound to the amount of memory that can be allocated by the verifier to 2^N bytes.
This limits should be set as closely as possible to the amount of phisical memory available on the machine. 
If not set, the verifier could pass the limit of available phisical memory and starts using virtual memory that result in
degradation of performance

-DMEMLIM=N
Sets an upper-bound to the amount of memory that can be allocated by the verifier to N Megabytes. 
( gcc -DMEMLIM=600 -o pan pan.c -> sets the limit to 600 megabyte)

-DNOCLAIM
If promela model has never claims, these will be excluded from the verification attempt.

-DNP
Includes the code in the verifier for non-progress cycle detection, which in turn enables run-time option -l and simultaneously disables
run-time option -a for the detection of standard acceptance cycles.

-DON_EXIT=STRING
The name ON_EXIT can be used to define an external procedure name that, If defined will be called immediately after the veirifer
has printed its final statistics on a verificaion run and just before the verifier exits.

-DPROV=file
If the name PROV is defined, the verifier will arrange to execute whatever code segment is defined in the file 'file' into the verifier source text.
at a point just before the search starts.
