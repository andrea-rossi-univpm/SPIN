Pathfinder was a rover landed on Mars surface ib July 4th 1997.
The hardest part was to design software instead of the rest of the spacecraft.

The bad design ended with the craft to lose contact with the Earth at unpredictable moments. 
Causing valuable time to be lost in the transfer of data.

Reason of bug: conflict between a mutual exclusion rule and a priority rule used in the real-time task scheduling algorithm.

Priority levels are modeled as active proctypes.
Both process (with high and low priority) need to access to a critical region for tranferring data. 
That critical region is procetected by a mutual exclusion lock.

BUG: if the high priority process starts running while the low priority process holds the lock, neither process CAN PROCEED.
This result in the hig priority process locked out by the mutex rule by a PROVIDED CALUSE ON THE LOW PRIORITY PROCESS.
