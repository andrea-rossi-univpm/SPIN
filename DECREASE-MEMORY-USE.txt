-DBITSTATE
Uses the bitstate storage alghorithm instead of default exhaustive storage.

-DHC
Enables the hash-compact storage method. The state descriptor is replaced with a 64-bit hash-value that is stored in a conventional hash table.
Variations can be done using: HC0 (32bit), HC1 (40bit), HC2 (48bit), HC3 (56 bit).

-DCOLLAPSE
Compress the state descriptors using an indexing method, which increases run time but can significantly reduce the memory requirements.

-DMA=N
Enables the minimized automaton storage method to encode state descriptors.

-DSC
Enables a stack cycling method, which can be useful for verifications that require an unusually large depth-limit.
The memory requirements for the stack increase linearly with its maximum depth.
