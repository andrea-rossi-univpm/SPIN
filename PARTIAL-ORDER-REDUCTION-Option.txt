-DNOREDUCE
Disable the partial order reduction algorithm and arranges for the verifier to perform an exhaustive full state exploration, 
without reductions.
This increases both the time and the memory requirements for the verification process.

-DXUSAFE
Disables the validity checks on xr and xs assertions. This improve the performance of the verifier.
