SPIN can also be used for less drastic checks (not every time for deadlocks, starvations or mutual exclusion contexts!)
In this case we want to do more generic search.
Use of SPIN probabilistic.
Which is the probability that the assertion is violated? with 10 iteration at least! 
The assertion is violated if n is less equal than 2.

The idea is to perform with a script many times spin execution and then make a statistics with collected datas.

spin -p -g test.pml -> show interleaving with possibily sequentializations.

spin test.pml simply execute the model.
