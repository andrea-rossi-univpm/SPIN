Model Checker Generation:

-a
Generates source code that can be compiled and run to perform various types of verification of PROMELA model. 
The outup is written into a set of C files named PAN.

-n
If model contains never claims its convenient to store in a separate file, with -n its possibily to append claim to the file.

-o1
disable data flow optimization in verifier.

-o2
disable the elimination of write only variables from the state descriptor.

-o3
disables he statement merging technique.

-o4
enables a more experimental rendezvous optimization technique. (attempt to precompute the feasibility of rendezvous operations)

-o5
disables the case caching technique

-s1 and -s2 
separate compilation options (if never claims file is a lot smaller versus model file its convenient to compile separately.
